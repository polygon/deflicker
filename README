A small tool that reads a series of images given on the command line. It will calculate the average luminance of each picture and will then smooth the resulting curve. The images will then have their luminance adjusted accordingly. This will hopefully remove brightness flickering frequently seen in timelapse image series. This may be caused by the aperture opening a little more or less during exposure.
